This strategy turns the non-zero values into probabilities, and creates a row substochastic matrix. Basically, this means that when you add the values of each row, some of the totals will equal 1 and the rest will equal zero. The zero totals happen because of the dangling nodes or rank sinks. For a row stochastic matrix all the rows must add up to 1.\n",

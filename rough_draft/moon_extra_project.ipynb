They identify the important nodes in a given graph and those nodes are defined as vertices with many direct or indirect connections.  One of the centrality algorithms is called $PageRank(PR)$ which identify most important vertices of a graph by measuring the direct influence of nodes based on proportional rank.

This strategy turns the non-zero values into probabilities, and creates a row substochastic matrix. Basically, this means that when you add the values of each row, some of the totals will equal 1 and the rest will equal zero. The zero totals happen because of the dangling nodes or rank sinks. For a row stochastic matrix all the rows must add up to 1.\n",

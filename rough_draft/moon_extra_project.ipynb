    "[6]Convergence is achieved when the error rate for any vertex in the graph falls below a given threshold value. The error rate of a vertex comuted by difference between the “real” score of the vertex PR(Vi) and the score computed at iteration I, PR^I(Vi) . The error rate is approximated at PR^(I+1)(Vi)+ PR^(I)(Vi).\n",

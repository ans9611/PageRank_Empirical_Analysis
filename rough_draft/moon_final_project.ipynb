    "Centrality algorithms are one of the categories of graph algorithms. They identify the important nodes in a given graph and those nodes are defined as vertices with many direct or indirect connections.  One of the centrality algorithms is called $PageRank(PR)$ which identify most important vertices of a graph by measuring the direct influence of nodes based on proportional rank.  [2] PR is invented by Larray Page and used by Google Search to rank web pages in their search engine results.\n",

The PageRank computations require several passes, called \"iterations\", through the collection to adjust approximate PageRank values to more closely reflect the theoretical true value.\n",
